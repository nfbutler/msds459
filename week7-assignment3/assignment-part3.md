## Explanation of Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is a method used to evaluate the value of a security by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Analysts use financial statements, economic indicators, and market trends to assess a company's performance and predict future stock price movements. Evaluating 'Qualitative Factors' could include assessing management quality, company strategy, and other non-measurable factors that can influence a company's long-term value. In our term paper, this could include 'media sentiment' for example.

## Benefits and Limitations of Fundamental Analysis

### Benefits:

1.  **Informed Decision-Making**: By analyzing a company's fundamentals, investors can make informed investment decisions based on actual performance rather than market speculation.
2.  **Long-Term Investment Strategy**: This would be important for long-term investors who want to understand a company's true value and growth potential over time.
3.  **Identifying Undervalued Stocks**: Helps investors find stocks that are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value, providing opportunities for profit.

### Limitations:

1.  **Time-Consuming**: Conducting thorough fundamental analysis requires significant time and effort to collect and interpret data.
2.  **Market Sentiment**: Market prices may not always reflect fundamental values due to market sentiment and psychological factors, leading to potential misalignment.
3.  **Dependence on Accurate Data**: If the financial data used is inaccurate or outdated, it can lead to poor investment decisions.

## Utilization of Fundamental Analysis in the Term Project

In the context of your term project, which focuses on analyzing the relationship between public sentiment and stock market performance for major technology companies (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft), fundamental analysis can be utilized in the following ways:

**Integration of Financial Data**: Fundamental analysis can provide critical financial metrics such as revenue, profit margins, and earnings per share (EPS) for the selected companies. This data can be integrated with sentiment analysis to provide a more informed analysis of how public sentiment relates to financial performance.

**Evaluating Performance Trends**: By analyzing historical financial data alongside news sentiment, our project can assess how fundamental factors influence stock price movements. This can help identify patterns that correlate positive sentiment with financial results.

**Predictive Modeling**: Utilizing fundamental metrics as inputs in predictive models can enhance the accuracy of forecasting stock price movements based on sentiment analysis. For example, combining earnings reports with sentiment scores can provide a more comprehensive model.

**Comparative Analysis**: Fundamental analysis allows for comparative assessments of the four companies, identifying which firms have stronger financial health and how that correlates with sentiment and market performance.

By leveraging fundamental analysis, our project will be better equipped to deliver insights into how public perceptions, as influenced by media sentiment, impact the financial outcomes of well-established technology companies. This approach will enhance the project's analytical depth and relevance in understanding market dynamics.Â
