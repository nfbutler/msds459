## Understanding Technical Analysis

**Technical Analysis** is a method used to evaluate investments by analyzing statistical trends derived from trading activity, such as price movement and volume. Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on a companyâ€™s financials and market position, technical analysis primarily examines price charts and patterns to predict future price movements.

## Benefits of Technical Analysis

1.  **Market Psychology Insight**: Technical analysis captures the collective behavior and sentiment of market participants, helping traders anticipate potential market movements.
2.  **Timing**: It aids in determining optimal entry and exit points for trades (buy low sell high), which can enhance profitability.
3.  **Visualization**: Price charts provide clear visuals of trends and patterns, making it easier for investors to make decisions.
4.  **Flexibility**: Technical analysis can be applied across various assets, including stocks, commodities, currencies, and cryptocurrencies.

## Limitations of Technical Analysis

1.  **Subjectivity**: Different analysts may interpret the same chart or indicator in various ways, leading to differing conclusions.
2.  **Market Efficiency**: In highly efficient markets, past price movements may not be indicative of future trends, rendering technical analysis less effective.
3.  **False Signals**: Technical indicators can sometimes produce misleading signals, resulting in losses if trades are executed based solely on them.
4.  **Lack of Fundamental Insight**: It does not consider fundamental factors that can impact a security's value, such as earnings reports or economic data.

## Utilization of Technical Analysis in the Term Project

In the context of the term project focused on analyzing the relationship between public sentiment and stock market performance for major technology companies, technical analysis can be utilized in the following ways:

**Price Movement Patterns**: By integrating technical analysis with sentiment analysis, the project could evaluate how specific patterns (e.g., support and resistance levels, moving averages) correlate with public sentiment and news events. This could enhance predictions about stock price movements following significant news releases.

**Visualizing Trends**: Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands could be employed to visualize trends in stock prices for Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. These indicators would allow for a more comprehensive understanding of how sentiment impacts technical performance over time.

**Backtesting Predictions**: Using historical data, our team can backtest predictions derived from the integration of technical analysis and sentiment analysis to assess their accuracy and effectiveness. This can provide insights into potential future performance based on past patterns.
