# Summary and Overall Recommendation

Given the scope of our term project and the 6-week remaining timeline, EdgeDB/Gel may be the best choice for developing a knowledge graph database. Its ability to handle complex relationships while providing a flexible schema aligns well with the requirements of a knowledge graph. Additionally, EdgeDB's support for modern query languages can facilitate efficient data manipulation and retrieval, which is essential for your project.

Regarding the incorporation of machine learning and if we plan to use vector embeddings extensively, pgvector can be considered as an additional component to enhance EdgeDB, but EdgeDBâ€™s broader capabilities make it a strong standalone choice for the knowledge graph.

Ultimately, we should also consider our familiarity with the technologies and the time required to learn any new systems, especially given our previous experience with Python and vector databases.
